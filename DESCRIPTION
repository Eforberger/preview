Description: Preview allows for quick and easy conversion, grouping, and graphing of likert scale pilot data. 
    Conversion and grouping rely on info in an organizational file created by the user. 
    The specifics of this file are outlined below. The oranization file specifies a group, 
    subgroup, category, and type for each column in the data sheet. The grouping can be done 
    regardless of the data being grouped, and may prove useful, even if the conversion and 
    graphing are not. This package is meant to create one page per group, where a page is a
    sheet of graphs (and tables) for all the data in the group. A columns group determines 
    which page it is on, it's subgroup determines what columns it shares a graph with, and 
    it's category determines how the data on the graph should be grouped. For example, if 
    column 1 and column 2 are both in group X, subgroup A, category 1, the data from each 
    column will be mixed together on the graph. If column 1 is in category 1, and column 2 is in category 2,
    Then each column will be kept seperate on the graph.
